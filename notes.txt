H = "     "   H+=....
(not actually sure what I meant by this)

var thing; thing += 9; thing === NaN, not a number as expected

c = 'constructor'
c[c][c]('arbitrary code execution')()

Array.from("Hello there!", a => String.prototype.charCodeAt.bind(a)()).map(a => a.toString(2)).map(a => ("0000000000000000" + a).slice(-16)).join('').replace(/0/g, '\u200B').replace(/1/g, '\u200C')

Excuses for magic numbers - "need to skip first and last mouse movements"

undefined as a string - var a; a+= ''

alphabet string is justified - can hide things in it or use magic numbers to reference parts of it to form things

octal literals look different than the value - 071 === 57

setTimeout(0, function) = puts things at the end of the event loop

var x = new Boolean("false");
if (x) {
  // this code is executed
}
var y = new Boolean(false);
if (y) {
  // this code is also executed
}
(There is a lot of quirks around Boolean objects - see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)

Comma operators can be deceptive
(function (a) {
  var three = 3
  if (a === 1)
    return "one!" /* long comment with lots of characters */,
  three = "three!"
  return "two!"
}(1))
